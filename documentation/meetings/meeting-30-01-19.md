# Meeting

Date: 30-01-19

## Scope

- Logic area: Propositional logic
- Logic paradigm: Constructive logic
- Platform/frameworks: TBD
  - Programming languages: TBD
    - Frontend:
    - Backend:
  - Server/client architecture
- Audience: TBD
- ...

## Brainstorming of visualisation ideas

### Basic logic model

Introduction and Elimination of:

- Negation (¬)
- Conjunction (∧)
- Disjunction (∨)
- Implication (→)

### Background/side-effect

- Cracks in ice, when fail -> do die
- Growing trees with tree cutting leaves
- Card idea
- Recursive combined structures/trees should have "leaf"-resolution before branches can be solved

## Decide on project name

Project Tenjin

## Decide on personal, project and effect goals

- Personal:
  - Learn about how to create pleasing visualisations and user interfaces
  - Gain a deeper understanding of logic
  - Learn more about creating advanced applications on the mobile platform
  - Learn more about the application of logic to programming on a deeper level
  - Learn more about server-client communication over the Internet
- Project:
  - Create a fully functional model based on the problem statement, that is extendable and fully UI-agnostic
  - Have wireframes, models and mockups to back up the prototype design decisions.
- Effect:
  - Give individuals of diverse ages the possibility of learning about logic and proofs in an intuitive, fun and hand-held environment.

## Problem statement for thesis

> Is it possible produce an intuitive visualisation for constructive propositional logic?

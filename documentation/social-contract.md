## Whole group culture

- Be on time for meetings
  - Always inform the group at least 10 min beforehand if you are running late
- Never resort to passive aggression, handle the conflict instead
- Respect each other
  - We have zero tolerance for bullying
  - Listen to each other and don't interrupt each other
- Ask for help!
  - Be aware of where you are at with the tasks you have taken on, and make sure to inform the others at least one day ahead of the deadline if you are not going to make it
  - Always ask if something is unclear or if there is something that you are unfamiliar with
  - Questions/discussional topics that are given need to be answered/confirmed by the others within 24 hours.
- We will give continuous, **constructive** feedback on each members' performance
  - Each sprint will be finished off with a retrospective, where necessary feedback will be given to each member of the team.
- Each member will keep their work updated on the Scrum board

## Meetings

- Whole group meetings will be held once a week for administration and sprint recaps
  - Max 1 hour.
- When a discussion is held on a specific subject, the following rules apply:
  - Switching subject is prohibited until the current discussion is finished
- The secretary for the meeting will be decided at the beginning of each meeting with the assistance of [random.org](https://random.org)
  - Documentation needs to be made for each meeting
- Daily stand ups will be held
  - If we are not meeting in person, it will be done over slack
- All design-models will be added to the common directory. Arbitrary models will be put in the "documentation/models"-dir.

## Workload and responsibilies

- If anybody feels that the workload is imbalanced, they need to inform the team about it as soon as possible
- The baseline workload hours will be ~25 hours a week
- Every member will contribute material from the respective area of responsibility to all parts of the project

## Decisions and conflicts

- Conflicts will preferably be solved using discussion and logical reasoning
  - If there is no real resolution, voting will be the deciding factor
  - If the voting ends in a draw, [random.org](https://random.org) will be used to decide the outcome
